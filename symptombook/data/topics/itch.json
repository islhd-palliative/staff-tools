      "overview": "It is not in the scope of this booklet to cover decubitus ulcers or specific approaches to dressings and debridement. The main point to put across is the importance of managing and preventing odours when ulcers have a necrotic base and are infected by anaerobic bacteria.\n\nMetronidazole gel dressings: Apply twice daily or with each dressing. This can be very expensive and an alternative option is to make up a gel by suspending 100mg of the intravenous formulation in 10gm of hydrogel (can use lubricant gel) and applying to the wound surface. This can also be combined with morphine (10mg/10g gel) for local pain relief and/or sucralfate 1gm tablet crushed and mixed in the gel for haemostasis. Care should be taken not to have topical contact with metronidazole preparations.\n\nMetronidazole tablets can be crushed and sprinkled, or a suspension of metronidazole for injection can be sprayed on the wound surface using an atomizer prior to dressings without mixing in a gel. Note that complete sterility is not a primary concern where we are aiming to palliate symptoms rather than heal wounds.\n\nOral or rectal metronidazole can be given in addition, or as an alternative to local wound applications. To clean up an infected ulcer combination with a suitable broad-spectrum antibiotic can be successful. This is best guided by a wound swab and culture for sensitivities, and a long-term plan that might include continuing low-dose antibiotics or antibiotic rotations. Serious infections complicated by large areas of ulceration or systemic symptoms are best managed by initial intra-venous antibiotics if this is clinically appropriate.",
